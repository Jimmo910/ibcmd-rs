//! What the decoder took along from the root crate's `mssql_dump`.
//!
//! The two standard-picture identifiers moved here with the decoder, their
//! only reader. The helpers it shares with the root (`parse_uuid_field`,
//! `parse_non_zero_uuid`, `xml_bool`, `extract_base64_payload`) are the
//! `ibcmd-1c-text` crate's.
//!
//! The code came from the physical-adapter guard's slice, so the guard scans
//! this file too (`tools/validate-physical-adapter-policy.ps1`) and its
//! literals stay in the guard's baseline. The rest of the crate was outside
//! that slice before the move and stays outside it.

// Platform-level 1C standard pictures, not metadata UUIDs from one database.
