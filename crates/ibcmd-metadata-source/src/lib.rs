//! What the packers of a configuration's stored bodies read of its XML
//! source tree, as one seam: [`MetadataSource`]. A writer that takes a
//! `&dyn MetadataSource` reads the tree only through it, so it can live in a
//! crate that does not depend on the packers (`ibcmd-metadata-blob`, whose
//! `MetadataSourceContext` is the implementation the tools build), and a test
//! can answer it with a stub.
//!
//! The types the seam returns are here too: a source file's bytes
//! ([`SourceBytes`]), and the answers the context memoises for the interface
//! and help writers ([`InterfaceResolutionMemo`], [`HelpReference`]). They
//! moved from `ibcmd-metadata-blob`, which re-exports them.
//!
//! They came from the physical-adapter guard's slice, so the guard scans
//! every non-test `*.rs` file under this crate's `src/`
//! (`$GuardedCrateDirectories` in `tools/validate-physical-adapter-policy.ps1`).
//! A file added here is in the slice at once and fails the guard until its
//! record is reviewed.
