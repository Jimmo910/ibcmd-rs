# Native and private-copy evidence

Native executable: 1C 8.5.1.1592, x86_64 on macOS arm64 through Rosetta. Empty inventory additionally measured on 8.3.27.2214. All commands used disposable laboratory file databases, explicit external data/temp directories, and no user database writes. Exact commands, stdout/stderr and hashes are retained privately in the external laboratory.

The committed corpus is exclusively repository-owned tiny/clean-room data: real native imports for add/change/delete/rename, full XML and status/delta outputs, and owned-form recursion. The fixture manifest records hashes and command templates. Differential tests compare complete stdout/files/errors, not normalized XML. Configuration and Language versions can change on native import while their XML bytes stay identical; status compares stored versions independently of byte comparisons.

## Large private-copy measurement (pre-final build)

One warm run per operation; release build, two conversion/output threads, no cache flush or machine tuning. No proprietary names, source XML, database or CF are included here. The 4.51 GB laboratory copy remained byte-identical (SHA-256 before/after). Native inventory and our inventory were byte-identical (45,836,493 bytes). All 105,253 version rows had canonical owners, with zero unmapped entries.

| Operation | Elapsed seconds | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Rust info | 28.623 | rc 0, byte-identical native inventory |
| Rust full export | 92.570 | rc 0, 125,083 files |
| Rust unchanged base | 30.035 | rc 0, no output directory created |
| Rust one-row delta | 55.922 | rc 0, exact native paths and bytes |
| Native one-row delta | 30.327 | rc 0 |
| Rust unchanged sync | 30.265 | rc 0, all file timestamps/sizes unchanged |

The changed reference alters one saved module version, not database content. Relative to this Rust full export, unchanged base is 3.08x faster and one-row delta is 1.66x faster. The native delta is faster than the Rust delta; these measurements do not establish general platform performance. A final-build recheck is recorded separately after final validation.


## PR review follow-up (2026-10-23)

The five inline review findings were reproduced and corrected: query input errors
are no longer disguised as output-directory failures; generic sync failures do
not reuse the success sentence's final period; info/status accept benign linked
parent directories while still rejecting linked final entries; failed staged
writes and renames clean up only the operation's owned staging file after closing
its handle; and the default-platform subprocess clears an inherited platform
override.

Native 8.5.1.1592 and the corrected queries produced identical inventory/status
bytes through an explicitly selected directory alias on a new repository-owned
tiny database. Its before/after SHA-256 was unchanged. Fifteen query integration
cases include missing/malformed references and databases, linked/dangling final
entries, missing nested parents, and directory-required spellings that must not
replace an existing sentinel file. Two unit cases inject a partial write failure
and exercise a failed rename, checking destination preservation and staging cleanup.
The query suite also passes with the parent environment's IBCMD_RS_PLATFORM=8.5.1.

Directory-alias resolution is restricted to the caller-selected info/status
output. Object containment and source descriptor guards are unchanged. This
path-based publication does not claim protection against hostile concurrent
ancestor replacement. The independent review identified and verified the fix for
terminal dot-component normalization before approving the changes subject to gates.
The additional unverified items-after-test-module note was confirmed with real
root Clippy; moving the unchanged inventory helper above the tests removes it.
The physical policy baseline and scanner remain unchanged.

Exploratory root `cargo clippy --lib --tests` also reports a pre-existing
`clippy::never_loop` denial in unchanged `src/mssql_apply.rs`; that broader
research-crate lint run is not green. The mandatory standalone workspace Clippy
command excludes the root crate and passes unchanged.

Local review-follow-up gates: formatting, all-target workspace check, required
standalone Clippy, 1,252 standalone tests (80 ignored), 427 root integration tests
(4 ignored), release build, strict OpenSpec and physical policy/self-tests pass.
The 15 query cases and both staging tests pass; the final helper reorder has an
additional check/query/unit recheck. Independent review found no remaining P1/P2.
Exact-head multi-platform workflow results are recorded in the PR separately.


## Codex follow-up: output safety and actual-selection validation (2026-10-23)

On the preceding PR head, disposable own tiny databases/files reproduced three
reported failures: an explicitly empty objects output overwrote a cwd sentinel;
root/ancestor aliases bypassed the object output guard; and an unsuccessful query
left an earlier `ok: true` JSON report untouched. These were local executions of
our branch, not executions of another contributor's code or of private ERP data.

The parser now refuses an explicit empty output before database resolution, and
the objects API independently rejects an empty path. Object roots retain lexical
paths and check links/reparse points before resolution; info/status parent alias
support remains query-specific. Failed queries publish the original error in an
`ok: false` report, with any report failure reported separately.

Four real-pipeline tests first failed on the old native incremental boundary.
The final isolated child-process regression checks removed rows, renamed owners,
removed nested parts, renamed body-row roles, and unchanged existing sync output.
It bypasses the CLI preflight deliberately to exercise the inventory actually
used for export. Its isolation avoids the physical offline adapter's process-wide
active state interfering with unrelated parallel unit tests. Native selection
requires exact current reference-row names through the shared typed source-asset
routing, and rejects unreadable names. Custom fallback remains covered separately.
Both earlier directory preparations are deferred until this validation succeeds.
Only reference IDs require additional routing, so unlisted native tail entries do
not acquire an extra validation demand. This is a pre-publication guard, not a
claim of SQL transaction snapshot consistency.

Independent static review found and closed the body-role gap and the potential
extra routing demand for unlisted tails. Physical policy baseline/scanner remain
unchanged. Exact final-head local and CI results are recorded in the PR receipt.
Native Windows console encoding/line-ending parity is still unmeasured locally;
the supplied Windows cp866/CRLF observation is additional human evidence, not a
result of the Mac 8.5.1.1592 oracle used here.

Local follow-up checks: 1,252 standalone tests passed (80 ignored), 430 root
integration tests passed (4 ignored), 18 query cases, 9 custom base/sync cases,
13 incremental unit cases and the isolated five-scenario native pipeline case
passed. Formatting, all-target workspace check, mandatory standalone Clippy,
strict OpenSpec and physical policy/self-tests passed. Release compilation was
interrupted by the coordinator's build-slot rescheduling after tests completed;
it remains pending and is not recorded as a compiler failure or a passed gate.
