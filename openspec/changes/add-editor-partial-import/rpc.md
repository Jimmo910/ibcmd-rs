# Editor import protocol 1.2

Existing 1.1 clients are accepted. SQL objects/import retains its previous contract. rows-dir stays read-only. New verified editor import currently supports Unix file-db connections with measured collation; Windows refuses the new CAS path explicitly.

Prepare (exactly one selection mode):

```json
{"method":"objects/import/prepare","params":{"infobase":"lab","sourceDir":"/workspace/src","files":["Documents/Example/Ext/ObjectModule.bsl"]}}
```

`objects:["Document.Example"]` selects existing objects, including their owned files. `changed:true` selects local differences only when their synchronized ConfigDumpInfo row identity/name/version still agrees with the effective target. Missing/stale baseline fails before publication. Import does not automatically rewrite the source inventory: refresh it after synchronization, or use explicit file selection when reviewing a conflict.

Response: `{plan, preflight:{target, files, ready, missingReferences}}`. Missing references include an optional suggestedObject. Adding dependencies is a separate user-confirmed scope change and requires a fresh preflight; new objects remain unsupported. A plan with unresolved references cannot publish.

Publish:

```json
{"method":"objects/import","params":{"infobase":"lab","sourceDir":"/workspace/src","plan":"opaque-preflight-token","confirm":true}}
```

Without confirmation there is no write and the plan remains usable. Tokens are one-use, bound to the connection generation, canonical target inode/content and source census. A reconnect invalidates all pending tokens. Source or target changes require a fresh preflight. There is one pending plan per connection, at most four per server.

VSCode commands: `ibcmd.importSelected` accepts file Uri selections or #380 Row values `{object,uri}`; `ibcmd.importChanged` validates Explorer URI context and otherwise uses the current connection. `ibcmd.sourceDirectory` (default `.`) is workspace-relative. File/object selection outside that source tree and dirty files are refused. Source/connection/settings are rechecked after each asynchronous confirmation. Dependency consent and final file-list consent are separate; cancellation is forwarded through $/cancelRequest. Early known validation messages are typed and displayed; unknown connection errors retain existing sanitization.

No production extension code launches native ibcmd. Applying the stage belongs to #384 and the platform. `config/pending` remains unavailable for file-db in this slice; the UI reports pending unknown rather than asserting no pending changes.

## MCP integration boundary

The common guard API supplies consumed descriptor metadata and a final publication policy gate. Untrusted consumers use `prepare_guarded_with_limits(target, source, selection, platform, guard, ReadControl { limits, check })`. `limits` is `ibcmd_filedb::ReadLimits { max_records, max_binary_bytes, max_object_bytes }`; `check` is `Arc<dyn Fn() -> ibcmd_filedb::Result<()> + Send + Sync>` retained by the opaque Plan. `publish_guarded` needs no separate budget argument.

`open_for_write_with_limits` acquires the lock and invokes the caller guard on actual descriptor metadata BEFORE parsing database descriptors. One cumulative budget covers metadata, FAT vectors, index expansion and repeated CONFIG/CONFIGSAVE reads, including aliases. Preparation and publication each get a fresh bounded session under the same limits. Snapshot hashing, copy loops, page/record/blob walks and final publication observe the callback. The retained callback runs again after long source/policy checks, immediately before the final global cancellation check and publication. The synchronous engine also supports the existing `cancel::scope` for cancellation while compiling/exporting the expected tree.

The adapter must still supply its own exact startup dev/ino, settings/policy bytes, source-root identity and opt-in checks through `guard` on EVERY call, including the final publication gate. This API does not authorize agent writes. MCP integration and its end-to-end validation belong to #386.

## Temporary data and publication failures

Each prepare owns a private 0700 scratch directory. A lifecycle guard removes only that runtime-owned directory on success, error, cancellation or unwind; a completed Plan contains verified rows, not persistent copies of the configuration. Deliberately retained native-oracle lab evidence lives elsewhere. An abrupt process termination can still leave owned scratch for operator inspection.

Publication renames the verified new database first, retaining the previous backup until that succeeds. If database publication fails, the original data and old backup remain unchanged. If the following backup publication fails, `ibcmd_filedb::Error::Published { recovery, error }` explicitly reports that the new database IS published; the complete pre-write database remains at `.ibcmd-rs.bak.new`, and the older `.ibcmd-rs.bak` remains unchanged. No destructive rollback is attempted. The caller must report this recovery state and inspect it before retrying. A late cancellation cannot overwrite this outcome. A leftover `.bak.new` blocks subsequent writes. Fault-injection tests cover both rename failures.

For untrusted consumers, `prepare_guarded_with_source_limits` takes an explicit
`SourceInventoryLimits` alongside retained `ReadControl`. The guarded path also
limits source directory entries (including empty directories) to `max_files`
and depth to64, through initial custody and every final revalidation. The walker
keeps admitted ancestor iterators open to avoid eager directory caching outside
the entry budget. Source census checks cancellation per entry; original file
reads and hashing check it per64 KiB chunk. Ordinary editor `prepare` retains
its existing source admission defaults. These controls do not replace consumer
policy checks or prove descriptor-relative publication confinement.
